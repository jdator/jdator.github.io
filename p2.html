<center><p><h1>Bahay Babaylan</h1></p></center>
   <p> &emsp; Welcome to Bahay Babaylan, or House of the Babaylan. After listening to an episode of Filipina On the Rise, a podcast hosted by Krystl Fabella, I was inspired to create this virtual reality installation dedicated to the Filipino shamans called Babaylans. Babaylan refers to the pre-colonial tradition of female mystical healers whose spiritual connectedness was a source of political and social power. Babaylans served as bridges between the spiritual and material world and were warriors, healers, and priestesses who led their communities through their deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of life. Although a majority of Babaylans were women, men could also be shamans who would then assume the role of a woman. It was believed that, “There is no spirituality without femininity,” and this was considered a vehicle to the spirit world. The videos in this space feature the burning of bayabas (guava) leaves for spiritual cleansing, nature scenes incorporating music by Filipina artist ((( O ))), and a brief history of the Babaylans and their healing arts. This is a space for healing, learning, and decolonizing our minds, welcome to all who choose to enter.
