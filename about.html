<div><p>&emsp; <h6> I often find myself reflecting on what it means to continue the journey of the Philippine diaspora and to navigate my identity as a Filipina-American. Growing up and learning under the American education system, I had a very limited knowledge of my own culture’s history. After being exposed to multicultural spaces, educators, artists, and communities while attending college in San Jose, I felt empowered to expand my knowledge of Filipino culture to reconnect with my roots. The Philippines’ history has been long entangled with the United States’ and our culture has evolved with each generation, bringing significant contributions to society while recovering from the traumas and erasure of colonialism and imperialism. My project series explores pre-colonial Philippine mythology, spiritualism, and healing practices, weaving some of the traditions of the past with the present and making them accessible for viewers to experience in the digital realm. By learning where we come from, we can understand how we got here and be more intentional about where we are going.  
“Diwata”, also known as “Anito” in other regions of the Philippines, translates to spirit. Diwata originated from the Sanskrit word devata, meaning “deity”, one of the Hindu influences that was adopted in the Pre-Hispanic beliefs of ancient Filipinos. Diwatas are known as ancestor spirits, nature spirits, and deities that exist in the material and spiritual world and are responsible for natural phenomena. The physical representation of these spirits in some regions is represented by carved figures called “taotao” (little human) or “Bulul” (from the Ifugao tribe). These figures were made out of materials such as wood, stone, or ivory and were worshipped to honor the ancestors and bring abundance during the rice harvest season. “Diwata” inspired the name of the first microsatellite designed, developed and assembled by a team of Filipino researchers and engineers and launched in March 2016. According to the PHL Microsat Program, Diwata-1 was created for weather forecasting, determining damage extent during natural disasters, determining the health and composition of the ocean, and imaging natural and cultural heritage sites. A second satellite, Diwata-2, was launched in October 2018 and carries radio communication technology that allows people in the Philippines to relay messages to any part of the country for disaster relief operations. Diwata-3 is a VR environment combining these two representations of Diwata and features a 3D sculpted bulul figure sitting on the satellite, quite literally a spirit of nature watching over our planet. 
&emsp; <p> My second project, Bahay Babaylan, translates to House of the Babaylan, or House of the Healer in Tagalog. After listening to Filipina On the Rise, a podcast hosted by Krystl Fabella, I was inspired to create this virtual reality space as a cultural museum dedicated to Filipino shamans called Babaylans. Babaylan refers to the pre-colonial tradition of female mystical healers whose spiritual connectedness was a source of political and social power. Babaylans served as bridges between the spiritual and material world and were warriors, healers, and priestesses who led their communities through their deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of life. Although a majority of Babaylans were women, men could also be shamans identifying with femininity. It was believed that, “There is no spirituality without femininity,” as this was considered a vehicle to the spirit world. The videos in this space feature the burning of bayabas (guava) leaves for spiritual cleansing, nature scenes incorporating music by Filipina artist ((( O ))), and a Babaylan performing hilot, an ancient healing art involving intuition and massage. This is a space for healing, learning, and decolonizing, welcome to all who choose to enter. 
&emsp;<p> For my final project I learned how to write “Pangako” (promise) in Baybayin. This piece symbolizes the promise I’ve made to myself to continue my journey inward, learning more about my roots and planting new seeds along the way. Baybayin was one of the pre-colonial writing scripts of the Tagalog region in the Philippines. “Baybay” translates to “write” or “spell”. Baybayin script has been growing in popularity among many Filipinos who want to reclaim their ancient traditions and identities, however, this was not the only script that was developed during the pre-colonial period. Other regions such as Pampanga, my mother’s province, also had their own writing system, a variation of Baybayin called Kulitan. Although Baybayin does not represent the entire archipelago’s writing system as a whole, acknowledging its existence along with other ancient scripts is a way to honor the work of our ancestors. 
<p> &emsp;I hope that these pieces serve as a reminder of the inner strength and universal wisdom rooted deep within our cultures and identities.
