<div><p>&emsp;I often find myself reflecting on what it means to continue the journey of the Philippine diaspora and how I can navigate my Filipino-American identity. After attending college and being exposed to multicultural spaces, educators, artists, and communities in San Jose, I felt empowered to seek and expand my knowledge of Filipino culture to honor my heritage. The Philippines’ history is entangled with the United States’, and our culture has evolved with each generation, bringing significant contributions to several parts of American society while recovering from the traumas and erasure of colonialism and imperialism. This project series explores pre-colonial Philippine mythology, spiritualism, and healing practices that take the form of new media. </p>
<p>
&emsp;My first project is a 3D model of an Anito, also known as “Diwata” among the Visayan people in the central region of the Philippine archipelago. Diwata originated from the Sanskrit word devata, meaning “deity”, one of the Hindu influences adopted in the Pre-Hispanic beliefs of ancient Filipinos. Diwatas are known as ancestor spirits, nature spirits, and deities that exist in the material and spiritual world and are responsible for natural phenomena. The physical representation of these spirits in some regions is represented by carved figures called “taotao” (little human) or “Bulul” (from the Ifugao tribe) and were made out of materials such as wood, stone, or ivory. These figures were worshipped to honor ancestors and bring abundance of rice production. Diwata is also the name of the first microsatellite designed, developed and assembled by Filipino researchers and engineers guided by Japanese experts from Hokkaido and Tohoku University. According to the PHL Microsat Program, Diwata was created for damage extent determination during disasters and calamities, imaging natural and cultural heritage sites, determining the health and composition of the ocean, identifying distribution and magnitude of harmful algal blooms, monitoring coastal ecosystems, complementing current weather forecasting capabilities, and imaging cloud formations and typhoons. My 3D object and environment is a combination of these two representations of Diwata, with the sculpted taotao figure in the traditional squatting position orbiting the earth in space, quite literally a spirit watching over our planet. If you have ever heard of the phrase, “we are our ancestors' wildest dreams” I think modern day Filipinos developing this satellite and giving it the name Diwata is an honor to the ancestors.</p>

<p>&emsp;The name of my second project is called Bahay Babaylan, which translates to House of the Babaylan, or House of the Healer. I was inspired to create this digital space/cultural museum dedicated to these Filipino shamans after listening to Filipina On the Rise, a podcast hosted by Krystl Fabella. The episode is called “‘Womanhood in Pre-Colonial Philippines was fierce and tender, all at once’ – Gabes Torres on Filipina history, Decolonizing your Identity, & Reclaiming your Innate Worth.” Before the Spanish colonized the Philippines, there existed a 500 year long tradition of indigenous feminism which predated women’s liberation in the West. Babaylan refers to the pre-colonial tradition of female mystical healers whose spiritual connectedness was a source of political and social power. Babaylans served as bridges between the spiritual and material world, interacting with Anitos/Diwatas. They were warriors, healers, and priestesses who listened to their communities and led through deeper understanding of interconnectedness of life forms. Although a majority of them were women, Babaylans did not assign gender roles and men could also be shamans, identifying with femininity which was considered a vehicle to the spirit world. It was believed that, “There is no spirituality without femininity.” The videos in this space feature the burning of bayabas (guava) leaves for cleansing, clips of nature incorporating music by Filipina artist ((( O ))), and a Babaylan performing hilot, an ancient healing art involving intuition and massage. This is a space for healing, welcome to all who choose to enter.</p>

<p>&emsp;My final project is a timelapse of a digital illustration written in Baybayin, “baybay” which translates to “write” or “spell” in Tagalog. Before Spanish colonization, Baybayin was the ancient writing script of the Tagalogs in the Philippines. Baybayin is growing in popularity but this was not the only script that was developed during the pre-colonial period. Other regions such as Pampanga, my mother’s province, had also created their own writing system called Kulitan before its use declined. Although Baybayin does not represent the entire archipelago’s writing system as a whole, acknowledging it and other ancient scripts is a way to remember and honor the systems of communication that Filipinos created. 
By learning where we come from and honoring the traditions of our ancestors, we can make choices to better ourselves and serve our communities. I hope that sharing this art is a reminder of our ancestral cultures as sources of inner strength and Universal Wisdom. </p>
