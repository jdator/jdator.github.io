<p><h6> &emsp; My name is Jasmine and I'm a graphic designer and digital media artist based in the Bay Area. The mediums I work with include Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere, and Procreate. More recently, I've been exploring 3D modeling with Blender and creating immersive virtual reality spaces. The themes in my work are inspired by music, the dualities of nature, the resilience of my loved ones, and the power in identity and culture. I hope to create visual poetry that inspires collective dialogue, reflection, action, and liberation.

<p> &emsp; As a Filipina-American I often find myself reflecting on what it means to continue the journey of the Philippine diaspora and how to navigate my identity. Growing up and learning under the American education system, I had a very limited knowledge of my own culture’s history. After being exposed to multicultural spaces, educators, artists, and communities while attending college in San Jose, I felt empowered to expand my knowledge of Filipino culture and history to reconnect with my roots. My recent projects explore pre-colonial Philippine mythology, spiritualism, and healing practices, weaving traditions of the past together with the present and making them accessible for viewers to experience in the digital realm. By learning where we come from, we can reclaim what was erased and be more intentional about where we are going.

<p> &emsp; My project Diwata-3 is my first attempt at 3D modeling and VR display using A-frame. “Diwata”, also known as “Anito” in other regions of the Philippines, translates to spirit. Diwata originated from the Sanskrit word devata, meaning “deity”, and was one of the Hindu influences adopted during the pre-Hispanic era. Diwatas are known as ancestor spirits, nature spirits, and deities existing in the material and spiritual world and were believed to be responsible for natural phenomena. In some regions, these spirits were represented by carved figures called “taotao” (little human) or “Bulul” (from the Ifugao tribe), and were made out of natural materials such as wood, stone, or ivory. Filipinos placed these figures in their homes and prayed to them to honor the ancestors and bring abundance to their rice harvests. “Diwata” also inspired the name of the first microsatellite designed, developed and assembled by a team of Filipino researchers and engineers in March 2016. According to the PHL Microsat Program, Diwata-1 was created for weather forecasting, determining damage extent during natural disasters, determining the health and composition of the ocean, and imaging natural and cultural heritage sites. A second satellite, Diwata-2, was launched in October 2018 and carries radio communication technology allowing people in the Philippines to relay messages to any part of the country during disaster relief operations. Diwata-3 is a play on the two representations of Diwata. It features a 3D sculpted bulul figure sitting on the satellite in orbit, celebrating the fact that we quite literally have a spirit of nature watching over our planet. We are truly our ancestors wildest dreams.

<p> &emsp; My second project, Bahay Babaylan, translates to House of the Babaylan. After listening to Filipina On the Rise, a podcast hosted by Krystl Fabella, I was inspired to create this virtual reality installation dedicated to the Filipino shamans called Babaylans. Babaylan refers to the pre-colonial tradition of female mystical healers whose spiritual connectedness was a source of political and social power. Babaylans served as bridges between the spiritual and material world and were warriors, healers, and priestesses who led their communities through their deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of life. Although a majority of Babaylans were women, men could also be shamans who would then assume the role of a woman. It was believed that, “There is no spirituality without femininity,” and this was considered a vehicle to the spirit world. The videos in this space feature the burning of bayabas (guava) leaves for spiritual cleansing, nature scenes incorporating music by Filipina artist ((( O ))), and a brief history of the Babaylans and their healing arts. This is a space for healing, learning, and decolonizing our minds, welcome to all who choose to enter. 

<p> &emsp; For my final project I learned how to write “Pangako” (promise) in Baybayin. This piece symbolizes the promise I’ve made to myself to continue my journey inward, learning more about my roots and planting new seeds along the way. Baybayin was one of the pre-colonial writing scripts of the Tagalog region in the Philippines. “Baybay” translates to “write” or “spell”. Baybayin script has been growing in popularity among many Filipinos who want to reclaim their ancient traditions and identities, however, this was not the only script that was developed during the pre-colonial period. Other regions such as Pampanga, my mother’s province, also had their own writing system, a variation of Baybayin called Kulitan. Although Baybayin does not represent the entire archipelago’s writing system as a whole, acknowledging its existence along with other ancient scripts is a way to honor the work of our ancestors. 

<center><p> &emsp; I hope that these pieces serve as a reminder of our inner strength and the universal wisdom deeply rooted within our identities.</center>
