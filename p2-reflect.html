   <p><h6>Title: Reflection Eternal
<p>Date: October 2020 
<p>Medium: Video, Mozilla Hubs 3D environment
<p>Dimension: 1920x1080</center>
<p>&emsp;Reflection Eternal is an outdoor floating video installation inspired by Japanese zen gardens and reflection pools. I wanted to incorporate my 5-shot video along with a mix of original videos and images I have collected over the years from some of my trips to create a peaceful, immersive nature experience. Since I did not have a projector available at home, I decided to host this project in Mozilla Hubs. I created a symmetrical path of stepping stone platforms within a lake as my gallery space to resemble a Japanese garden and used an image I took of koi fish from the Peace garden at the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum in San Jose as the “pond” centerpiece. The waterfall video was taken at Alamere falls and provided a nice backdrop and audio/visual element and plays on loop, almost like it is flowing into the lake and pond area. I also added in a picture I took of the beach at sunset in Santa Cruz as a pop of color to compliment the sunset beyond the lake. I would expect viewers to experience this installation as an open space for reflection, meditation, healing, and finding inner alignment within nature. Too often we humans separate ourselves from nature and a lot of the natural disasters we have experienced this year have shown us how much we need to improve our relationship with it. The pandemic also pushed us to look within ourselves and find peace in stillness. The name of this space is inspired by Nujabes’ song Reflection Eternal and is an ode to this special time in our lives.
